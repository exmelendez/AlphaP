# Tater Pop

## Introduction
Welcome to TaterPop. An updated, nostalgic classic, of the hot potato game where a digital potato is flung across the screen and onto the screen of another friend's device.

## Why? / How?
We wanted to create a game that was initially meant to be played physically and figure out how we could reinvent it digitally. We envisioned a game that might be used to create, comforting social environments among children or adults. Everything from parties, school settings to work ice breakers.

#### Playing the Game
After the splash screen is displayed, the user is able to scroll horizontally and select the option to create or join a game.
